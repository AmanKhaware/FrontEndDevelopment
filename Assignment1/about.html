        <p>
            The property was purchased from Rev. Garrett in 1873 at a cost of Rs. 40,000 by the British Guardians of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X using his personal funds. They were in charge of his education and administrative training to ready him to take over his reign in 1881 AD. As the young Maharaja did not have a suitable place to stay during his training in Bengaluru, this property was purchased and transformed.
            Construction of a palace building was started in April 1874 and completed by 1878. Mr. Cameron of Lalbagh did the landscaping.
            Many additions and improvements were carried out in subsequent years. In the later years, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar added some portions outside of Durbar Hall e.g. the twin external staircase and platform for musicians.[1] The palace has a floor area of 45,000 sft, and grounds of 454 acres.
